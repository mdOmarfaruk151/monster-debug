                    local storage exists until explicitly deleted, you can use

                    Session storage is only valid for one tab, you would use it
                    when you want to store data that should not be accessible
                    from other tabs.

                    For example, if you have a ticket purchasing flow on your
                    website, you would want to use session storage so that the
                    user can only purchase one ticket per tab, and the two
                    separate ticket purchasing tabs do not interfere with each
                    other.

                    Use local storage when you want to share data between tabs
                    or windows. So, if you have a shopping cart on your website
                    and you want the user to be able to access their cart from
                    any tab, you would need to use local storage.

                <td>
                  <h5>
                    Session storage is a good candidate for temporary data that
                    you want to store to improve the user experience or
                    performance of your website.

                    Blocks in Javascript would include if-statements, loops etc.
                    Prior to ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ES2015) Javascript had no block
                    scopes. A block prior to this would have worked as follows.

                    stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not to
                    be confused with empty object literals.

            3. How The Event Loop Works ?
          </h3>
          <hr />
          <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="even loop.jpeg" alt="" />
          <h5 class="mt-3 mx-5 my-5">
            The event loop utilizes three major components, Call Stack, Event
            Queue, and WebAPIs/C++ APIs. It manages function calls in a way that
            asynchronous events would go into the event queue and will be called
            only after the call stack is empty.
            <br />
            <br />
            Call stack holds all the synchronous function calls. Call stack will
            execute code in a last in first out approach. So last the most inner
            nested code will be executed first and then one level above that and
            so on. If the function call is asynchronous it will add a new call
            entry on WebAPIs and the API will add a new call to the callback
            queue after the asynchronous action is done.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now we have two stacks with functions to be executed. This is where
            the Event Loop comes in. Event Loop’s job is to watch Callback Queue
            and Call Stack, whenever Call Stack is empty and we have called in
            Callback Queue. The event loop will move calls to Call Stack and
            execute them in succession. So to explain it in different terms, the
            event loop will wait until all blocking/synchronous code is done and
            then add asynchronous calls into the call stack. This simple
            architectural approach is what allows javascript to handle way more
            requests than the traditional multi-threaded synchronous approach.

            4. How Many Ways We Get Undefined ?
          </h2>
          <hr />
          <h5 class="mt-3 mx-5 my-5">
            1. An undefined variable or anything without a value will always
            return "undefined" in JavaScript.

            <hr />
            2. When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is
            assigned to it, JavaScript automatically displays "undefined".

            <hr />
            3. When you try accessing values in, for example, an array or object
            that doesn’t exist, it will throw undefined.

            <hr />
            4. One of the first methods that comes to mind is direct comparison.
            This is where you compare the output to see if it returns undefined.
            <br />
            <br />
            let user = { name: "John Doe", age: 14 };
            <br />
            <br />
            if (user.hobby === undefined) {
            <br />

            console.log("This is undefined"); }
            <br />
            <br />
            This also works for arrays as you can see below:
            <br />
            <br />
            let scores = [12, 34, 66, 78];
            <br />
            <br />
            if (scores[10] === undefined) {
            <br />

            console.log("This is undefined"); }
            <br />
            <hr />
            5. We can also use the type of the variable to check if it’s
            undefined. Luckily for us undefined is a datatype for an undefined
            value as you can see below:
            <br />
            <br />
            let name;
            <br />

            console.log(typeof name); // "undefined"

            <hr />
            6. The void operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive
            value. You can do this using "void(0)" which is similar to "void 0"
            as you can see below:
            <br />
            <br />
            console.log(void 0); // undefined
            <br />
            <br />
            console.log(void(0)); // undefined
            <hr />
